# Numworks-Zombies-Reloaded
A recreation of the Numworks Zombies game a made for the Numworks calculator

## Features

### Brilliant gameplay
You shoot these tic-tac looking enemies (or zombies as the code likes to call them) until they die. And you gain points, wich are as usefull as karma on reddit (aka you think it makes you cool but it doesn't).

### Realistic shooting mechanism
Left click for the win baby, shoot were and when you want just like in the US, and (hopefully) aim better than the dude who missed Trump in Pennsylvania.
Just don't use an autoclicker, otherwise you'll be surprised...

### Death
This game is so good you'll wish for it after playing for too long. 
You can also die in-game when not respecting social distancing with the tic-tacs for too long and taking too much damage, but don't worry, health regenerates *very* slowly, so you'll have to suffer through the game a bit more.
When you're dead (in the game, maybe irl too idk), an inspirational quote shows up along with your score to impress all of your friends who are nice or stupid enough to play this.

### Cutting-edge graphics
White background. Rambo looking tic-tac. Enemies are green tic-tac. Score is just a number. Health is just a bar. So simple yet so good you'll wish GTA VI looked like this.

### Easily modable
You can change every 4 sprites of the game, but make sure they are not the right size format, so they'll look like shit.
You can also change the totally legally obtained background music to anything you like. Have fun playing with baby shark in the background for maximum ear bleeding!
